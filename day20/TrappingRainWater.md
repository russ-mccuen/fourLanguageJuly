Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.  
  
Example:  
  
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]  
Output: 6  

Further explanation:  

You're given a list of bar heights â€” imagine them as vertical walls. After it rains, water collects in the dips between taller walls.  

Example:  

[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]  

Visually (each | is a wall):

Water gets trapped in the dips like a bowl.  
You want to compute how many units of water can be held.
