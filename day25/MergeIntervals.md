Given an array of intervals where each interval is represented as [start, end], merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the merged intervals.

Example:

Input:  [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]  
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Constraints:

Intervals may be unsorted.

Must return non-overlapping intervals covering all input intervals.
