String Compression

Problem:
Given a string s, compress it using the counts of repeated characters.

For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" becomes "a2b1c5a3".

Rules:

If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, return the original string instead.

The string consists only of uppercase and lowercase letters (no spaces, digits, or symbols).
