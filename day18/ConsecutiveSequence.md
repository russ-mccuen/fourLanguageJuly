Longest Consecutive Sequence

    Given an unsorted array of integers, return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.  
    Length of list/array and numbers generated pseudo-randomly.

    Example:  
      
    Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]  
    Output: 4 (because the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest)
