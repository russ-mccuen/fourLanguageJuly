Write a program that takes a list of integers and returns true if it is a valid mountain array.

A mountain array must:

    Have at least 3 elements

    Strictly increase to a single peak, then strictly decrease

    No plateaus (i.e., adjacent equal numbers)

Examples:

    [0, 3, 2, 1] → true

    [2, 1] → false

    [3, 5, 5] → false

    [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0] → true
