Word Frequency Counter

Ask the user to enter a sentence.
Print each word along with how many times it appears.

    Ignore case (e.g., "The" and "the" count as the same word)

    Strip punctuation (optional for now, depending on language)

    Output should look like:

    the: 2  
    cat: 1  
    sat: 1  
    on: 1  
    mat: 1
