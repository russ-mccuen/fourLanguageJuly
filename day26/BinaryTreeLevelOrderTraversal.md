Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return its level order traversal as a list of lists of values (i.e., left to right, level by level).

Example:

<img width="244" height="173" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d430e187-ae30-466a-8be5-cee0fba2da86" />

Constraints:

Tree may be unbalanced.

Must return levels in correct order (top to bottom, left to right).

Use BFS (queue-based approach).
